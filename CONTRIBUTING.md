# Contributing to the project

You can contribute to the repository with issues and pull requests (PRs). Simply
filing issues for problems you encounter is a great way to contribute. Contributing
code is greatly appreciated.

## Reporting Issues

We always welcome bug reports, API proposals and overall feedback. Here are a few
tips on how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

### Where to Report

New issues can be reported in our
[list of issues](https://github.com/daveRendon/azinsider/issues).

Before filing a new issue, please search the list of issues to make sure it does
not already exist.

If you do find an existing issue for what you wanted to report, please include
your own feedback in the discussion. Do consider upvoting (üëç reaction) the original
post, as this helps us prioritize popular issues in our backlog.

### Writing a Good Bug Report

Good bug reports make it easier for maintainers to verify and root cause the
underlying problem.
The better a bug report, the faster the problem will be resolved. Ideally, a bug
report should contain the following information:

- A high-level description of the problem.
- A _minimal reproduction_, i.e. the smallest size of code/configuration required
  to reproduce the wrong behavior.
- A description of the _expected behavior_, contrasted with the _actual behavior_ observed.
- Information on the environment: OS/distribution, CPU architecture, SDK version, etc.
- Additional information, e.g. Is it a regression from previous versions? Are there
  any known workarounds?

## Contributing Changes

Project maintainers will merge accepted code changes from contributors.


### Breaking Changes

Contributions must maintain API signature and behavioral compatibility. Contributions
that include breaking changes will be rejected. Please file an issue to discuss
your idea or change if you believe that a breaking change is warranted.
